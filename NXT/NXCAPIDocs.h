/** @page intro Introduction
 * \brief
 * 
 * NXC stands for Not eXactly C. It is a simple language for programming the LEGO MINDSTORMS 
 * NXT product. The NXT has a bytecode interpreter (provided by LEGO), which can be used to 
 * execute programs. The NXC compiler translates a source program into NXT bytecodes, which 
 * can then be executed on the target itself. Although the preprocessor and control structures 
 * of NXC are very similar to C, NXC is not a general-purpose programming language - there 
 * are many restrictions that stem from limitations of the NXT bytecode interpreter.
 * 
 * Logically, NXC is defined as two separate pieces. The NXC language describes the syntax 
 * to be used in writing programs. The NXC Application Programming Interface (API) describes 
 * the system functions, constants, and macros that can be used by programs. This API is 
 * defined in a special file known as a "header file" which is, by default, automatically 
 * included when compiling a program.
 * 
 * This document describes both the NXC language and the NXC API. In short, it provides 
 * the information needed to write NXC programs. Since there are different interfaces for 
 * NXC, this document does not describe how to use any specific NXC implementation (such 
 * as the command-line compiler or Bricx Command Center). Refer to the documentation provided 
 * with the NXC tool, such as the NXC User Manual, for information specific to that implementation.
 * 
 * For up-to-date information and documentation for NXC, visit the NXC website at 
 * http://bricxcc.sourceforge.net/nxc/.

/** @page lang The NXC Language
 * \brief
 *
 * This section describes the NXC language. This includes the lexical rules used by the compiler, 
 * the structure of programs, statements and expressions, and the operation of the preprocessor.
 * 
 * NXC is a case-sensitive language, just like C and C++, which means the identifier "xYz" is 
 * not the same identifier as "Xyz". Similarly, the "if" statement begins with the keyword "if" 
 * but "iF", "If", or "IF" are all just valid identifiers - not keywords.
 * 
 * - @subpage lexrules
 * - @subpage progstruct
 * - @subpage statements
 * - @subpage expressions
 * - @subpage preproc
 *
 */

/** @page lexrules Lexical Rules
 * \brief
 *
 * The lexical rules describe how NXC breaks a source file into individual tokens. This includes 
 * the way comments are written, the handling of whitespace, and valid characters for identifiers.

/** @page progstruct Program Structure
 * \brief
 * 
 * An NXC program is composed of code blocks and variables. There are two distinct types of code 
 * blocks: tasks and functions. Each type of code block has its own unique features, but they share 
 * a common structure. The maximum number of code blocks of both tasks and functions combined is 256.
 * 
 * - @subpage codeorder
 * - @subpage tasks
 * - @subpage func
 * - @subpage vars
 * - @subpage structs
 * - @subpage arrays
 *
 */

/** @page statements Statements
 * \brief
 * 
 * The body of a code block (task or function) is composed of statements. Statements are 
 * terminated with a semi-colon (';'), as you have seen in the example code above.
 * 
 * - @subpage vardecl
 * - @subpage asgn
 * - @subpage ctrls

 *
 */

/** @page expressions Expressions
 * \brief
 * 
 * Values are the most primitive type of expressions. More complicated expressions are 
 * formed from values using various operators.
 * 
 * Numerical constants in the NXT are represented as integers or floating point values. The 
 * type depends on the value of the constant. NXC internally uses 32 bit floating point math 
 * for constant expression evaluation. Numeric constants are written as either decimal (e.g. 
 * 123, 3.14) or hexadecimal (e.g. 0xABC). Presently, there is very little range checking on 
 * constants, so using a value larger than expected may produce unusual results.
 * 
 * Two special values are predefined: true and false. The value of false is zero (0), while 
 * the value of true is one (1). The same values hold for relational operators (e.g. <): when 
 * the relation is false the value is 0, otherwise the value is 1.
 * 
 * Values may be combined using operators. NXC operators are listed here in order of precedence 
 * from highest to lowest.
 *

 * \endcode

/** @page preproc The Preprocessor
 * \brief
 * 
 * NXC also includes a preprocessor that is modeled after the Standard C preprocessor. 
 * The C preprocessor processes a source code file before the compiler does. It handles 
 * such tasks as including code from other files, conditionally including or excluding 
 * blocks of code, stripping comments, defining simple and parameterized macros, and 
 * expanding macros wherever they are encountered in the source code. 
 * 
 * The NXC preprocessor implements the following standard preprocessor directives: 
 * \#include, \#define, \#ifdef, \#ifndef, \#endif, \#if, \#elif, \#undef, \#\#, \#line, 
 * \#error, and \#pragma. It also supports two non-standard directives: \#download and 
 * \#import. Its implementation is close to a standard C preprocessor's, so most preprocessor 
 * directives should work as C programmers expect in NXC. Any significant deviations are 
 * explained below.
 * 
 * - @subpage incl
 * - @subpage defn
 * - @subpage concat
 * - @subpage condcomp
 * - @subpage import
 * - @subpage downld
 *
 */

/** @page cmts Comments
 * \brief
 * 
 * Two forms of comments are supported in NXC. The first are traditional C comments. They begin 
 * with '/*' and end with '* /'. These comments are allowed to span multiple lines, but they cannot 
 * be nested.
 * \code
 * /* this is a comment */
 * 
 * /* this is a two
 *    line comment */
 * 
 * /* another comment...
 *    /* trying to nest...
 *       ending the inner comment...*/
 *    this text is no longer a comment! */
 * \endcode
 * The second form of comments supported in NXC begins with '//' and continues to the end of the current 
 * line. These are sometimes known as C++ style comments.
 * \code
 * // a single line comment
 * \endcode
 * As you might guess, the compiler ignores comments. Their only purpose is to allow the programmer 
 * to document the source code.
 * 
 */

/** @page wspace Whitespace
 * \brief
 * 
 * Whitespace consists of all spaces, tabs, and newlines. It is used to separate tokens and to 
 * make a program more readable. As long as the tokens are distinguishable, adding or subtracting 
 * whitespace has no effect on the meaning of a program. For example, the following lines of code 
 * both have the same meaning:
 * \code
 * x=2;
 * x   =  2  ;
 * \endcode
 * Some of the C++ operators consist of multiple characters. In order to preserve these tokens, 
 * whitespace cannot appear within them. In the example below, the first line uses a right shift 
 * operator ('>>'), but in the second line the added space causes the '>' symbols to be interpreted 
 * as two separate tokens and thus results in a compiler error.
 * \code
 * x = 1 >> 4; // set x to 1 right shifted by 4 bits
 * x = 1 > > 4; // error
 * \endcode
 * 
 */

/** @page consts Numerical Constants
 * \brief
 * 
 * Numerical constants may be written in either decimal or hexadecimal form. Decimal 
 * constants consist of one or more decimal digits. Decimal constants may optionally 
 * include a decimal point along with one or more decimal digits following the decimal 
 * point. Hexadecimal constants start with 0x or 0X followed by one or more hexadecimal 
 * digits.
 * \code
 * x = 10;  // set x to 10
 * x = 0x10; // set x to 16 (10 hex)
 * f = 10.5; // set f to 10.5
 * \endcode
 * 
 */

/** @page strch String and Character Constants
 * \brief
 * 
 * String constants in NXC, just as in C, are delimited with double quote characters. 
 * NXC has a string data type that makes strings easier to use than in C. Behind the scenes, 
 * a string is automatically converted into an array of bytes, with the last byte in the array 
 * being a zero. The final zero byte is generally referred to as the null terminator.
 * \code
 * TextOut(0, LCD_LINE1, "testing");
 * \endcode
 * Character constants in NXC are delimited with single quote characters and may contain a 
 * single ASCII character.  The value of a character constant is the numeric ASCII value of 
 * the character.
 * \code
 * char ch = 'a'; // ch == 97
 * \endcode
 * 
 */

/** @page idkey Identifiers and Keywords
 * \brief
 * 
 * Identifiers are used for variable, task, function, and subroutine names. The first character 
 * of an identifier must be an upper or lower case letter or the underscore ('_'). Remaining 
 * characters may be letters, numbers, and underscores.
 * 
 * A number of tokens are reserved for use in the NXC language itself. These are called keywords 
 * and may not be used as identifiers. A complete list of keywords appears below:
 *  
 * asm, bool, break, byte, case, char, const, continue, default, do, else, enum, false, float, for,
 * goto, if, inline, int, long, mutex, priority, repeat, return, safecall, short, start, stop, 
 * string, struct, sub, switch, task, true, typedef, unsigned, until, void, while
 * 
 */

/** @page codeorder Code Order
 * \brief
 *
 * Code order has two aspects: the order in which the code appears in the source code file 
 * and the order in which it is executed at runtime. The first will be referred to as the 
 * lexical order and the second as the runtime order.
 * 
 * The lexical order is important to the NXC compiler, but not to the NXT brick. This means that 
 * the order in which you write your task and function definitions has no effect on the runtime 
 * order. The rules controlling runtime order are:
 * 
 * -# There must be a task called main and this task will always run first.
 * -# The time at which any other task will run is determined by the API functions 
 * documented in \ref CommandModuleFunctions section.
 * -# A function will run whenever it is called from another block of code.
 * 
 * This last rule may seem trivial, but it has important consequences when multiple tasks are running. 
 * If a task calls a function that is already in the midst of running because it was called first by 
 * another task, unpredictable behavior and results may ensue. Tasks can share functions by treating 
 * them as shared resources and using mutexes to prevent one task from calling the function while another 
 * task is using it. The safecall keyword (see \ref func) may be used to simplify the coding.
 * 
 * The rules for lexical ordering are:
 * 
 * -# Any identifier naming a task or function must be known to the compiler before it is used in a code block.
 * -# A task or function definition makes its naming identifier known to the compiler.
 * -# A task or function declaration also makes a naming identifier known to the compiler.
 * -# Once a task or function is defined it cannot be redefined or declared.
 * -# Once a task or function is declared it cannot be redeclared.
 * 
 * Sometimes you will run into situations where is impossible or inconvenient to order the task 
 * and function definitions so the compiler knows every task or function name before it sees that 
 * name used in a code block. You can work around this by inserting task or function declarations 
 * of the form 
 *
 * <tt>
 *   <strong>task</strong> <em>name</em>();<br>
 *   <em>return_type name</em>(<em>argument_list</em>);
 * </tt>
 *
 * before the code block where the first usage occurs. The <tt><em>argument_list</em></tt> must match the 
 * list of formal arguments given later in the function's actual definition.
 *
 */

/** @page tasks Tasks
 * \brief
 * 
 * Since the NXT supports multi-threading, a task in NXC directly corresponds to an NXT thread. 
 * Tasks are defined using the task keyword with the syntax shown in the code sample below.
 * \code
 * task name()
 * {
 *   // the task's code is placed here
 * }
 * \endcode
 * The name of the task may be any legal identifier. A program must always have at least one 
 * task - named "main" - which is started whenever the program is run. The body of a task 
 * consists of a list of statements. 
 * 
 * You can start and stop tasks with the start and stop statements, which are discussed below. 
 * However, the primary mechanism for starting dependant tasks is scheduling them with either 
 * the \ref Precedes or the \ref Follows API function. 
 * 
 * The \ref StopAllTasks API function stops all currently running tasks. You can also stop all tasks 
 * using the \ref Stop function. A task can stop itself via the \ref ExitTo function. Finally, a task 
 * will stop itself simply by reaching the end of its body.
 * 
 * In the code sample below, the main task schedules a music task, a movement task, and a 
 * controller task before exiting and allowing these three tasks to start executing concurrently. 
 * The controller task waits ten seconds before stopping the music task, and then waits another 
 * five seconds before stopping all tasks to end the program.
 * \code
 * task music() {
 *   while (true) {
 *     PlayTone(TONE_A4, MS_500);
 *     Wait(MS_600);
 *   }
 * }
 * 
 * task movement() {
 *   while (true) {
 *     OnFwd(OUT_A, Random(100));
 *     Wait(Random(SEC_1));
 *   }
 * }
 * 
 * task controller() {
 *   Wait(SEC_10);
 *   stop music;
 *   Wait(SEC_5);
 *   StopAllTasks();
 * }
 * 
 * task main() {
 *   Precedes(music, movement, controller);
 * }
 * \endcode
 * 
 */

/** @page func Functions
 * \brief
 * 
 * It is often helpful to group a set of statements together into a single function, which 
 * your code can then call as needed. NXC supports functions with arguments and return 
 * values. Functions are defined using the syntax below.
 * \code
 * [safecall] [inline] return_type name(argument_list)
 * {
 * 	// body of the function
 * }
 * \endcode
 * The return type is the type of data returned. In the C programming language, functions 
 * must specify the type of data they return. Functions that do not return data simply return 
 * void.
 * 
 * The argument list may be empty, or may contain one or more argument definitions. An argument 
 * is defined by a type followed by a name. Commas separate multiple arguments. All values are 
 * represented as bool, char, byte, int, short, long, unsigned int, unsigned long, float, 
 * strings, struct types, or arrays of any type. 
 * 
 * NXC supports specifying a default value for function arguments that are not struct or array 
 * types. Simply add an equal sign followed by the default value. Specifying a default value 
 * makes the argument optional when you call the function. All optional arguments must be at 
 * the end of the argument list.
 * \code
 * int foo(int x, int y = 20)
 * {
 * 	return x*y;
 * }
 * 
 * task main()
 * {
 * 	NumOut(0, LCD_LINE1, foo(10)); outputs 200
 * 	NumOut(0, LCD_LINE2, foo(10, 5)); outputs 50
 * 	Wait(SEC_10); // wait 10 seconds
 * }
 * \endcode
 * NXC also supports passing arguments by value, by constant value, by reference, and by constant 
 * reference. These four modes for passing parameters into a function are discussed below.
 * 
 * When arguments are passed by value from the calling function or task to the called function 
 * the compiler must allocate a temporary variable to hold the argument. There are no restrictions 
 * on the type of value that may be used. However, since the function is working with a copy of the 
 * actual argument, the caller will not see any changes the called function makes to the value. In 
 * the example below, the function foo attempts to set the value of its argument to 2. This is 
 * perfectly legal, but since foo is working on a copy of the original argument, the variable y from 
 * the main task remains unchanged.
 * \code
 * void foo(int x)
 * {
 * 	x = 2;
 * }
 * 
 * task main()
 * {
 * 	int y = 1;	// y is now equal to 1
 * 	foo(y);	// y is still equal to 1!
 * }
 * \endcode
 * The second type of argument, const arg_type, is also passed by value. If the function is an 
 * inline function then arguments of this kind can sometimes be treated by the compiler as true 
 * constant values and can be evaluated at compile-time. If the function is not inline then the 
 * compiler treats the argument as if it were a constant reference, allowing you to pass either 
 * constants or variables. Being able to fully evaluate function arguments at compile-time can be 
 * important since some NXC API functions only work with true constant arguments.
 * \code
 * void foo(const int x)
 * {
 * 	PlayTone(x, MS_500);
 * 	x = 1;	// error - cannot modify argument
 * 	Wait(SEC_1);
 * }
 * 
 * task main()
 * {
 * 	int x = TONE_A4;
 * 	foo(TONE_A5);	// ok
 * 	foo(4*TONE_A3);	// expression is still constant
 * 	foo(x);	// x is not a constant but is okay
 * }
 * \endcode
 * The third type, arg_type &, passes arguments by reference rather than by value. This allows 
 * the called function to modify the value and have those changes be available in the calling 
 * function after the called function returns. However, only variables may be used when calling 
 * a function using arg_type & arguments:
 * \code
 * void foo(int &x)
 * {
 * 	x = 2;
 * }
 * 
 * task main()
 * {
 * 	int y = 1;	// y is equal to 1
 * 
 * 	foo(y);	// y is now equal to 2
 * 	foo(2);	// error - only variables allowed
 * }
 * \endcode
 * The fourth type, const arg_type &, is interesting. It is also passed by reference, but with 
 * the restriction that the called function is not allowed to modify the value. Because of this 
 * restriction, the compiler is able to pass anything, not just variables, to functions using 
 * this type of argument. Due to NXT firmware restrictions, passing an argument by reference in 
 * NXC is not as optimal as it is in C. A copy of the argument is still made but the compiler 
 * will enforce the restriction that the value may not be modified inside the called function.
 * 
 * Functions must be invoked with the correct number and type of arguments. The code example 
 * below shows several different legal and illegal calls to function foo. 
 * \code
 * void foo(int bar, const int baz)
 * {
 * 	// do something here...
 * }
 * 
 * task main()
 * {
 * 	int x;	// declare variable x
 * 	foo(1, 2);	// ok
 * 	foo(x, 2);	// ok
 * 	foo(2);	// error - wrong number of arguments!
 * }
 * \endcode
 * You can optionally mark NXC functions as inline functions. This means that each call to the 
 * function will create another copy of the function's code. Unless used judiciously, inline 
 * functions can lead to excessive code size.
 * 
 * If a function is not marked as inline then an actual NXT subroutine is created and the call 
 * to the function in NXC code will result in a subroutine call to the NXT subroutine. The total 
 * number of non-inline functions (aka subroutines) and tasks must not exceed 256.
 * 
 * Another optional keyword that can be specified prior to the return type of a function is the 
 * safecall keyword. If a function is marked as safecall then the compiler will synchronize the 
 * execution of this function across multiple threads by wrapping each call to the function in 
 * Acquire and Release calls. If a second thread tries to call a safecall function while another 
 * thread is executing it the second thread will have to wait until the function returns to the 
 * first thread.
 * 
 */

/** @page vars Variables
 * \brief
 * 
 * All variables in NXC are defined using one of the types listed in the table below. 
 * <center><table>
 * <tr><th>Type Name</th><th>Information</th></tr>
 * <tr><td>bool</td><td>8 bit unsigned</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>byte, unsigned char</td><td>8 bit unsigned</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>char</td><td>8 bit signed</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>unsigned int</td><td>16 bit unsigned</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>short, int</td><td>16 bit signed</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>unsigned long</td><td>32 bit unsigned</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>long</td><td>32 bit signed</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>float</td><td>32 bit floating point value (IEEE-754)</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>mutex</td><td>Special type used for mutually exclusive code access</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>string</td><td>Array of byte with a null terminator</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>Structure (struct)</td><td>User-defined structure types</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>Array</td><td>Arrays of any type</td></tr>
 * </table>
 * </center>
 * <center>Table 2. Variable Types</center>
 * Variables are declared using the keyword(s) for the desired type, followed by a comma-separated 
 * list of variable names and terminated by a semicolon (';'). Optionally, an initial value for 
 * each variable may be specified using an equals sign ('=') after the variable name. Several 
 * examples appear below:
 * \code
 * int x;  	// declare x
 * bool y,z;	// declare y and z
 * long a=1,b;	// declare a and b, initialize a to 1
 * float f=1.15, g; // declare f and g, initialize f
 * \endcode
 * Global variables are declared at the program scope (outside of any code block). Once declared, 
 * they may be used within all tasks, functions, and subroutines. Their scope begins at declaration 
 * and ends at the end of the program.
 * 
 * Local variables may be declared within tasks and functions. Such variables are only accessible 
 * within the code block in which they are defined. Specifically, their scope begins with their 
 * declaration and ends at the end of their code block. In the case of local variables, a compound 
 * statement (a group of statements bracketed by '{' and '}') is considered a block:
 * \code
 * int x;  // x is global
 * 
 * task main()
 * {
 * 	int y;  // y is local to task main
 * 	x = y; // ok
 * 	{	// begin compound statement
 * 		int z;  // local z declared
 * 		y = z; // ok
 * 	}
 * 	y = z; // error - z no longer in scope
 * }
 * 
 * task foo()
 * {
 * 	x = 1; // ok
 * 	y = 2; // error - y is not global
 * }
 * \endcode
 * 
 */

/** @page structs Structures
 * \brief
 * 
 * NXC supports user-defined aggregate types known as structs. These are declared 
 * very much like you declare structs in a C program. 
 * \code
 * struct car
 * {
 *   string car_type;
 *   int manu_year;
 * };
 * 
 * struct person
 * {
 *   string name;
 *   int age;
 *   car vehicle;
 * };
 * 
 * person myPerson;
 * \endcode
 * After you have defined the structure type you can use the new type to declare a variable 
 * or nested within another structure type declaration. Members (or fields) within the struct 
 * are accessed using a dot notation.
 * \code
 *   myPerson.age = 40;
 *   anotherPerson = myPerson;
 *   fooBar.car_type = "honda";
 *   fooBar.manu_year = anotherPerson.age;
 * \endcode
 * You can assign structs of the same type but the compiler will complain if the types 
 * do not match.
 * 
 */

/** @page arrays Arrays
 * \brief
 * 
 * NXC also support arrays. Arrays are declared the same way as ordinary variables, but 
 * with an open and close bracket following the variable name.
 * \code
 * int my_array[];  // declare an array with 0 elements
 * \endcode
 * To declare arrays with more than one dimension simply add more pairs of square brackets. 
 * The maximum number of dimensions supported in NXC is 4.
 * \code
 * bool my_array[][];  // declare a 2-dimensional array
 * \endcode
 * Arrays of up to two dimensions may be initialized at the point of declaration using the 
 * following syntax:
 * \code
 * int X[] = {1, 2, 3, 4}, Y[]={10, 10}; // 2 arrays
 * int matrix[][] = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}};
 * string cars[] = {"honda", "ford", "chevy"};
 * \endcode
 * The elements of an array are identified by their position within the array (called an 
 * index). The first element has an index of 0, the second has index 1, and so on. For example:
 * \code
 * my_array[0] = 123; // set first element to 123
 * my_array[1] = my_array[2]; // copy third into second
 * \endcode
 * You may also initialize local arrays or arrays with multiple dimensions using the ArrayInit 
 * function. The following example shows how to initialize a two-dimensional array using ArrayInit. 
 * It also demonstrates some of the supported array API functions and expressions.
 * \code
 * task main()
 * {
 *   int myArray[][];
 *   int myVector[] = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
 *   byte fooArray[][][];
 * 
 *   ArrayInit(myArray, myVector, 10); // 10 vectors
 *   ArrayInit(fooArray, myArray, 2); // 2 myArrays
 * 
 *   fooArray[1] = myArray;
 *   myArray[1][4] = 34;
 * 
 *   int ax[], ay[];
 *   ArrayBuild(ax, 5, 7);
 *   ArrayBuild(ay, 2, 10, 6, 43);
 *   int axlen = ArrayLen(ax);
 *   ArraySubset(ax, ay, 1, 2); // ax = {10, 6}
 *   if (ax == ay) {  
 *     // compare two arrays
 *     NumOut(0, LCD_LINE1, myArray[1][4]);
 *   }
 * }
 * \endcode
 * NXC also supports specifying an initial size for both global and local arrays. The compiler 
 * automatically generates the required code to correctly initialize the array to zeros. If an 
 * array declaration includes both a size and a set of initial values the size is ignored in 
 * favor of the specified values.
 * \code
 * task main()
 * {
 *   int myArray[10][10];
 *   int myVector[10];
 * 
 *   //ArrayInit(myVector, 0, 10); // 10 zeros in myVector
 *   //ArrayInit(myArray, myVector, 10); // 10 vectors myArray
 * }
 * \endcode
 * The calls to ArrayInit are not required since we specified the initial sizes in the preceding 
 * array declarations, which means the arrays were already initialized to all zeros. In fact, the 
 * myVector array declaration is not needed unless we have a use for myVector other than initializing 
 * myArray.

/** @page vardecl Variable Declaration
 * \brief
 * 
 * Variable declaration, which has already been discussed, is one type of statement. Its 
 * purpose is to declare a local variable (with optional initialization) for use within the 
 * code block. The syntax for a variable declaration is shown below.
 * \code
 * arg_type variables;
 * \endcode
 * Here arg_type must be one of the types supported by NXC. Following the type are variable 
 * names, which must be a comma-separated list of identifiers with optional initial values as 
 * shown in the code fragment below.
 * \code
 * name[=expression]
 * \endcode
 * Arrays of variables may also be declared:
 * \code
 * int array[n][=initializer];
 * \endcode
 * You can also define variables using user-defined aggregate structure types.
 * \code
 * struct TPerson {
 *   int age;
 *   string name;
 * };
 * TPerson bob; // cannot be initialized at declaration
 * \endcode
 * 
 */

/** @page asgn Assignment
 * \brief
 * 
 * Once declared, variables may be assigned the value of an expression using the 
 * syntax shown in the code sample below.
 * \code
 * variable assign_operator expression;
 * \endcode
 * There are nine different assignment operators. The most basic operator, '=', 
 * simply assigns the value of the expression to the variable. The other operators 
 * modify the variable's value in some other way as shown in the table below.
 * <center><table>
 * <tr><th>Operator</th><th>Action</th></tr>
 * <tr><td>=</td><td>Set variable to expression</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>+=</td><td>Add expression to variable</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>-=</td><td>Subtract expression from variable</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>*=</td><td>Multiple variable by expression</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>/=</td><td>Divide variable by expression</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>\%=</td><td>Set variable to remainder after dividing by expression</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>&amp;=</td><td>Bitwise AND expression into variable</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>|=</td><td>Bitwise OR expression into variable</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>^=</td><td>Bitwise exclusive OR into variable</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>||=</td><td>Set variable to absolute value of expression</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>+-=</td><td>Set variable to sign (-1,+1,0) of expression</td></tr>

 * <center>Table 3. Operators</center>
 * The code sample below shows a few of the different types of operators that you can

 * y = 7;	// set y to 7
 * x += y;	// x is 9, y is still 7

/** @page ctrls Control Structures
 * \brief
 * 
 * The simplest control structure is a compound statement. This is a list of statements 
 * enclosed within curly braces ('{' and '}'):
 * \code
 * {
 * 	x = 1;
 * 	y = 2;
 * }
 * \endcode
 * Although this may not seem very significant, it plays a crucial role in building more 
 * complicated control structures. Many control structures expect a single statement as 
 * their body. By using a compound statement, the same control structure can be used to 
 * control multiple statements.
 * 
 * The if statement evaluates a condition. If the condition is true, it executes one 
 * statement (the consequence). An optional second statement (the alternative), preceded by 
 * the keyword else, can be executed if the condition is false. The value of a condition is 
 * considered to be false only when it evaluates to zero. If it evaluates to any non-zero value, 
 * it is true. The two syntaxes for an if statement are shown below.
 * \code
 * if (condition) consequence
 * if (condition) consequence else alternative
 * \endcode
 * The condition of an if-statement must be enclosed in parentheses, as shown in the code 
 * sample below. The compound statement in the last example allows two statements to execute 
 * as a consequence of the condition being true.
 * \code
 * if (x==1) y = 2;
 * if (x==1) y = 3; else y = 4;
 * if (x==1) { y = 1; z = 2; }
 * \endcode
 * The while statement is used to construct a conditional loop. The condition is evaluated, and 
 * if true the body of the loop is executed, then the condition is tested again. This process 
 * continues until the condition becomes false (or a break statement is executed). The syntax 
 * for a while loop appears in the code fragment below.
 * \code
 * while (condition) body
 * \endcode
 * Because the body of a while statement must be a single statement, it is very common to use a 
 * compound statement as the body. The sample below illustrates this usage pattern.
 * \code
 * while(x < 10)
 * {
 * 	x = x+1;
 * 	y = y*2;
 * }
 * \endcode
 * A variant of the while loop is the do-while loop. The syntax for this control structure is 
 * shown below.
 * \code
 * do body while (condition)
 * \endcode
 * The difference between a while loop and a do-while loop is that the do-while loop always executes 
 * the body at least once, whereas the while loop may not execute it at all.
 * 
 * Another kind of loop is the for loop. It uses the syntax shown below.
 * \code
 * for(statement1 ; condition ; statement2) body
 * \endcode
 * A for loop always executes statement1, and then it repeatedly checks the condition. While the 
 * condition remains true, it executes the body followed by statement2. The for loop is equivalent to 
 * the code shown below.
 * \code
 * statement1;
 * while(condition)
 * {
 * 	body
 * 	statement2;
 * }
 * \endcode
 * The repeat statement executes a loop a specified number of times. This control structure is not 
 * included in the set of Standard C looping constructs. NXC inherits this statement from NQC. 
 * The syntax is shown below.
 * \code
 * repeat (expression) body
 * \endcode
 * The expression determines how many times the body will be executed. Note: the expression 
 * following the repeat keyword is evaluated a single time and then the body is repeated that 
 * number of times. This is different from both the while and do-while loops which evaluate 
 * their condition each time through the loop.
 * 
 * A switch statement executes one of several different code sections depending on the value of 
 * an expression. One or more case labels precede each code section. Each case must be a constant 
 * and unique within the switch statement. The switch statement evaluates the expression, and then 
 * looks for a matching case label. It will execute any statements following the matching case until 
 * either a break statement or the end of the switch is reached. A single default label may also be 
 * used - it will match any value not already appearing in a case label. A switch statement uses 
 * the syntax shown below.
 * \code
 * switch (expression) body
 * \endcode
 * The case and default labels of a switch statement are not statements in themselves - they are 
 * labels that precede statements. Multiple labels can precede the same statement. These labels 
 * have the syntax shown below.
 * \code
 * case constant_expression :
 * default :
 * \endcode
 * A typical switch statement might look like this:
 * \code
 * switch(x)
 * {
 * 	case 1:
 * 		// do something when X is 1
 * 		break;
 * 	case 2:
 * 	case 3:
 * 		// do something else when x is 2 or 3
 * 		break;
 * 	default:
 * 		// do this when x is not 1, 2, or 3
 * 		break;
 * }
 * \endcode
 * NXC also supports using string types in the switch expression and constant strings in case labels.
 * 
 * The goto statement forces a program to jump to the specified location. Statements in a program 
 * can be labeled by preceding them with an identifier and a colon. A goto statement then specifies 
 * the label that the program should jump to. For example, here is an infinite loop that increments 
 * a variable:  
 * \code
 * my_loop:
 * 	x++;
 * 	goto my_loop;
 * \endcode
 * The goto statement should be used sparingly and cautiously. In almost every case, control structures 
 * such as if, while, and switch make a program much more readable and maintainable than using goto.
 * 
 * NXC also defines an until macro for compatibility with NQC. This construct provides a convenient 
 * alternative to the while loop. The actual definition of until is shown below.
 * \code
 * #define until(c)	while(!(c))
 * \endcode
 * In other words, until will continue looping until the condition becomes true. It is most often used in 
 * conjunction with an empty body statement:
 * \code
 * until(EVENT_OCCURS);	// wait for some event to occur
 * \endcode
 * 
 */

/** @page asm The asm Statement
 * \brief
 * 
 * The asm statement is used to define many of the NXC API calls. The syntax of 
 * the statement is shown below.
 * \code
 * asm { 
 *  one or more lines of NBC assembly language
 * }
 * \endcode
 * The statement simply emits the body of the statement as NeXT Byte Codes (NBC) code 
 * and passes it directly to the NBC compiler's backend. The asm statement can often be 
 * used to optimize code so that it executes as fast as possible on the NXT firmware.  
 * The following example shows an asm block containing variable declarations, labels, 
 * and basic NBC statements as well as comments.
 * \code
 * asm { 
 * //      jmp __lbl00D5
 *       dseg segment
 *         sl0000 slong
 *         sl0005 slong
 *         bGTTrue byte
 *       dseg ends
 *       mov	sl0000, 0x0
 *       mov	sl0005, sl0000
 *       mov	sl0000, 0x1
 *       cmp	GT, bGTTrue, sl0005, sl0000
 *       set bGTTrue, FALSE
 *       brtst	EQ, __lbl00D5, bGTTrue
 *   __lbl00D5:
 * }
 * \endcode
 * A few NXC keywords have meaning only within an asm statement. These keywords provide 
 * a means for returning string or scalar values from asm statements and for using 
 * temporary variables of byte, word, long, and float types.
 * <center>

 * <center>Table 4. ASM Keywords</center>
 * The asm block statement and these special ASM keywords are used throughout the NXC API. You 
 * can have a look at the NXCDefs.h header file for several examples of how they are used. To 
 * keep the main NXC code as "C-like" as possible and for the sake of better readability NXC asm 
 * block statements can be wrapped in preprocessor macros and placed in custom header files which 
 * are included using \#include. The following example demonstrates using a macro wrapper around an 
 * asm block.
 * \code
 * #define SetMotorSpeed(port, cc, thresh, fast, slow) \
 *   asm { \
 *   set theSpeed, fast \
 *   brcmp cc, EndIfOut__I__, SV, thresh \

 *   OnFwd(port, theSpeed) \
 *   __IncI__ \
 * }

 */

/** @page otherst Other NXC Statements
 * \brief
 * 
 * A function call can also be a statement of the following form:
 * \code
 * name(arguments);
 * \endcode
 * The arguments list is a comma-separated list of expressions. The number and type of arguments 
 * supplied must match the definition of the function itself. Optionally, the return value may be 
 * assigned to a variable.
 * 
 * You can start or stop tasks with the following statements. The stop statement is only supported 
 * if you are running the enhanced NBC/NXC firmware on your NXT.
 * \code
 * start task_name;
 * stop task_name;
 * \endcode
 * You can adjust the priority of a task using the priority statement. Setting task priorities 
 * also requires the enhanced NBC/NXC firmware. A task's priority is simply the number of 
 * operations it will try to execute before yielding to another task. This usually is 20 operations.
 * \code
 * priority task_name, new_priority;
 * \endcode
 * Within loops (such as a while loop) you can use the break statement to exit the loop immediately. 
 * You can also use the continue statement to skip to the top of the next iteration of the loop.
 * \code
 * break;
 * continue;
 * \endcode
 * The break statement is also a critical component of most switch statements. It prevents code 
 * in subsequent code sections from being executed, which is usually a programmer's intent, by 
 * immediately exiting the switch statement. Missing break statements in a switch are a frequent 
 * source of hard-to-find bugs.
 * 
 * If you want a function to return a value or to return before it reaches the end of its code, 
 * use a return statement. An expression may optionally follow the return keyword and, when present, 
 * is the value returned by the function. The type of the expression must be compatible with the 
 * return type of the function.
 * \code
 * return [expression];
 * \endcode
 * Many expressions are not legal statements. A notable exception are expressions using 
 * increment (++) or decrement (--) operators.
 * \code
 * x++;
 * \endcode
 * The empty statement (just a bare semicolon) is also a legal statement.
 * 
 */

/** @page condtn Conditions
 * \brief
 * 
 * Comparing two expressions forms a condition. There are also two constant conditions - true and 
 * false - that always evaluate to true or false respectively. A condition may be negated with the 
 * logical negation operator, or two conditions combined with the logical AND and logical OR operators. 
 * Like most modern computer languages, NXC supports something called "short-circuit" evaluation of 
 * conditions. This means that if the entire value of the conditional can be logically determined by 
 * only evaluating the left hand term of the condition, then the right hand term will not be evaluated.
 * 
 * The table below summarizes the different types of conditions.
 * <center>
 * <table>
 * <tr><th>Condition</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
 * <tr><td>true</td><td>always true</td></tr>

 * It is up to the program to tell the NXT what kind of sensor is attached to each port. 
 * Calling \ref SetSensorType configures a sensor's type. There are 16 sensor types, each 
 * corresponding to a specific type of LEGO RCX or NXT sensor. Two of these types are 
 * for NXT I2C digital sensors, either 9V powered or unpowered, and a third is used to 
 * configure port S4 as a high-speed RS-485 serial port. A seventeenth type 
 * (\ref SENSOR_TYPE_CUSTOM) is for use with custom analog sensors. And an eighteenth type 
 * (\ref SENSOR_TYPE_NONE) is used to indicate that no sensor has been configured, effectively 
 * turning off the specified port.
 * 
 * In general, a program should configure the type to match the actual sensor. If a sensor 
 * port is configured as the wrong type, the NXT may not be able to read it accurately. 
 * Use either the \ref SensorTypes or the \ref NBCSensorTypeConstants.
 * 
 * The NXT allows a sensor to be configured in different modes. The sensor mode determines 
 * how a sensor's raw value is processed. Some modes only make sense for certain types of 
 * sensors, for example \ref SENSOR_MODE_ROTATION is useful only with rotation sensors. Call 
 * \ref SetSensorMode to set the sensor mode. The possible modes are shown below. Use either 
 * the \ref SensorModes or the \ref NBCSensorModeConstants.
 * 
 * When using the NXT, it is common to set both the type and mode at the same time. The 
 * \ref SetSensor function makes this process a little easier by providing a single function 
 * to call and a set of standard type/mode combinations. Use the \ref SensorTypeModes.
 * 
 * The NXT provides a boolean conversion for all sensors - not just touch sensors. This boolean 
 * conversion is normally based on preset thresholds for the raw value. A "low" value (less 
 * than 460) is a boolean value of 1. A high value (greater than 562) is a boolean value of 0. 
 * This conversion can be modified: a slope value between 0 and 31 may be added to a sensor's 
 * mode when calling SetSensorMode. If the sensor's value changes more than the slope value 
 * during a certain time (3ms), then the sensor's boolean state will change. This allows the 
 * boolean state to reflect rapid changes in the raw value. A rapid increase will result in a 
 * boolean value of 0, a rapid decrease is a boolean value of 1.
 * 
 * Even when a sensor is configured for some other mode (i.e. \ref SENSOR_MODE_PERCENT), the boolean 
 * conversion will still be carried out.

/** @defgroup OutputModule Output module
 * Constants and functions related to the Output module.
 * 
 * The NXT output module encompasses all the motor outputs.
 * 
 * Nearly all of the NXC API functions dealing with outputs take either a single output or a set of 
 * outputs as their first argument. Depending on the function call, the output or set of outputs 
 * may be a constant or a variable containing an appropriate output port value. The constants \ref OUT_A, 
 * \ref OUT_B, and \ref OUT_C are used to identify the three outputs. Unlike NQC, adding individual outputs 
 * together does not combine multiple outputs. Instead, the NXC API provides predefined combinations 
 * of outputs: \ref OUT_AB, \ref OUT_AC, \ref OUT_BC, and \ref OUT_ABC. Manually combining outputs involves creating an 
 * array and adding two or more of the three individual output constants to the array.
 * 
 * \ref Power levels can range 0 (lowest) to 100 (highest). Negative power levels reverse the direction of 
 * rotation (i.e., forward at a power level of -100 actually means reverse at a power level of 100).
 * 
 * The outputs each have several fields that define the current state of the output port. These 
 * fields are defined in the \ref OutputFieldConstants section.

/** @defgroup CommModule Comm module
 * Constants and functions related to the Comm module.
 * 
 * The NXT comm module encompasses support for all forms of Bluetooth, USB, and 
 * HiSpeed communication.
 * 
 * You can use the Bluetooth communication methods to send information to other 
 * devices connected to the NXT brick. The NXT firmware also implements a message 
 * queuing or mailbox system which you can access using these methods.
 * 
 * Communication via Bluetooth uses a master/slave connection system. One device 
 * must be designated as the master device before you run a program using Bluetooth. 
 * If the NXT is the master device then you can configure up to three slave devices 
 * using connection 1, 2, and 3 on the NXT brick. If your NXT is a slave device 
 * then connection 0 on the brick must be reserved for the master device.
 * 
 * Programs running on the master NXT brick can send packets of data to any connected 
 * slave devices using the BluetoothWrite method. Slave devices write response packets 
 * to the message queuing system where they wait for the master device to poll for the 
 * response.
 * 
 * Using the direct command protocol, a master device can send messages to slave NXT 
 * bricks in the form of text strings addressed to a particular mailbox. Each mailbox 
 * on the slave NXT brick is a circular message queue holding up to five messages. Each 
 * message can be up to 58 bytes long.
 * 
 * To send messages from a master NXT brick to a slave brick, use BluetoothWrite on 
 * the master brick to send a MessageWrite direct command packet to the slave. Then, 
 * you can use ReceiveMessage on the slave brick to read the message. The slave NXT 
 * brick must be running a program when an incoming message packet is received. Otherwise, 
 * the slave NXT brick ignores the message and the message is dropped.

 * 
 * The NXT loader module encompasses support for the NXT file system. The NXT supports creating files, 
 * opening existing files, reading, writing, renaming, and deleting files.
 * 
 * Files in the NXT file system must adhere to the 15.3 naming convention for a maximum 
 * filename length of 19 characters. While multiple files can be opened simultaneously, a 
 * maximum of 4 files can be open for writing at any given time.
 * 
 * When accessing files on the NXT, errors can occur. The NXC API defines several constants 
 * that define possible result codes. They are listed in the \ref LoaderErrors section.
 */

/** @defgroup SoundModule Sound module
 * Constants and functions related to the Sound module.
 * 
 * The NXT sound module encompasses all sound output features. The NXT provides support for 
 * playing basic tones as well as two different types of files. 
 * 
 * Sound files (.rso) are like .wav files. They contain thousands of sound samples that digitally 
 * represent an analog waveform. With sounds files the NXT can speak or play music or make just 
 * about any sound imaginable.
 * 
 * Melody files are like MIDI files. They contain multiple tones with each tone being defined 
 * by a frequency and duration pair. When played on the NXT a melody file sounds like a pure 
 * sine-wave tone generator playing back a series of notes. While not as fancy as sound files, 
 * melody files are usually much smaller than sound files.
 * 
 * When a sound or a file is played on the NXT, execution of the program does not wait for the 
 * previous playback to complete. To play multiple tones or files sequentially it is necessary to 
 * wait for the previous tone or file playback to complete first. This can be done via the Wait 
 * API function or by using the sound state value within a while loop.
 * 
 * The NXC API defines frequency and duration constants which may be used in calls to \ref PlayTone or 
 * \ref PlayToneEx. Frequency constants start with \ref TONE_A3 (the 'A' pitch in octave 3) and go to 
 * \ref TONE_B7 (the 'B' pitch in octave 7). Duration constants start with \ref MS_1 (1 millisecond) and 
 * go up to \ref MIN_1 (60000 milliseconds) with several constants in between. See NBCCommon.h for 
 * the complete list.

/** @defgroup LowSpeedModule Low Speed module
 * Constants and functions related to the Low Speed module.
 * 
 * The NXT low speed module encompasses support for digital I2C sensor communication.
 * 
 * Use the lowspeed (aka I2C) communication methods to access devices that use the I2C 
 * protocol on the NXT brick's four input ports.
 * 
 * You must set the input port's Type property to \ref SENSOR_TYPE_LOWSPEED or 
 * \ref SENSOR_TYPE_LOWSPEED_9V on a given port before using an I2C device on that port. Use 
 * \ref SENSOR_TYPE_LOWSPEED_9V if your device requires 9V power from the NXT brick. Remember 
 * that you also need to set the input port's InvalidData property to true after setting a 
 * new Type, and then wait in a loop for the NXT firmware to set InvalidData back to false. 
 * This process ensures that the firmware has time to properly initialize the port, including 
 * the 9V power lines, if applicable. Some digital devices might need additional time to 
 * initialize after power up.
 * 
 * The \ref SetSensorLowspeed API function sets the specified port to \ref SENSOR_TYPE_LOWSPEED_9V 
 * and calls \ref ResetSensor to perform the \ref InvalidData reset loop described above.
 * 
 * When communicating with I2C devices, the NXT firmware uses a master/slave setup in which 
 * the NXT brick is always the master device. This means that the firmware is responsible for 
 * controlling the write and read operations. The NXT firmware maintains write and read buffers 
 * for each port, and the three main Lowspeed (I2C) methods described below enable you to 
 * access these buffers.
 * 
 * A call to \ref LowspeedWrite starts an asynchronous transaction between the NXT brick and a 
 * digital I2C device. The program continues to run while the firmware manages sending 
 * bytes from the write buffer and reading the response bytes from the device. Because the 
 * NXT is the master device, you must also specify the number of bytes to expect from the 
 * device in response to each write operation. You can exchange up to 16 bytes in each 
 * direction per transaction.
 * 
 * After you start a write transaction with \ref LowspeedWrite, use \ref LowspeedStatus in a loop 
 * to check the status of the port. If \ref LowspeedStatus returns a status code of 0 and a 
 * count of bytes available in the read buffer, the system is ready for you to use 
 * \ref LowspeedRead to copy the data from the read buffer into the buffer you provide.
 * 
 * Note that any of these calls might return various status codes at any time. A status 
 * code of 0 means the port is idle and the last transaction (if any) did not result in 
 * any errors. Negative status codes and the positive status code 32 indicate errors. 
 * There are a few possible errors per call.
 * 
 * Valid low speed return values include \ref NO_ERR as well as the error codes 
 * listed in the \ref CommandCommErrors section.

/** @defgroup DisplayModule Display module
 * Constants and functions related to the Display module.
 * 
 * The NXT display module encompasses support for drawing to the NXT LCD. The NXT supports 
 * drawing points, lines, rectangles, and circles on the LCD. It supports drawing 
 * graphic icon files on the screen as well as text and numbers. With the enhanced NBC/NXC
 * firmware you can also draw ellipses and polygons as well as text and numbers using custom
 * RIC-based font files. Also, all of the drawing operations have several drawing options for
 * how the shapes are drawn to the LCD.
 * 
 * The LCD screen has its origin (0, 0) at the bottom left-hand corner of the screen with 
 * the positive Y-axis extending upward and the positive X-axis extending toward the right. 
 * The NXC API provides constants for use in the \ref NumOut and \ref TextOut functions which make 
 * it possible to specify LCD line numbers between 1 and 8 with line 1 being at the top of 
 * the screen and line 8 being at the bottom of the screen. These constants (\ref LCD_LINE1, 
 * \ref LCD_LINE2, \ref LCD_LINE3, \ref LCD_LINE4, \ref LCD_LINE5, \ref LCD_LINE6, \ref LCD_LINE7, \ref LCD_LINE8) 
 * should be used as the Y coordinate in NumOut and TextOut calls. Values of Y other than 
 * these constants will be adjusted so that text and numbers are on one of 8 fixed line 
 * positions.
