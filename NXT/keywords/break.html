<p> Within loops (such as a while loop) you can use the break statement to exit the loop immediately. You can also use the continue statement to skip to the top of the next iteration of the loop. </p>

<pre class="fragment">
 <span class="keywordflow">break</span>;
 <span class="keywordflow">continue</span>;
</pre></div>
<p> The break statement is also a critical component of most switch statements.
It prevents code in subsequent code sections from being executed, which is
usually a programmer's intent, by immediately exiting the switch statement.
Missing break statements in a switch are a frequent source of hard-to-find bugs.</p>
