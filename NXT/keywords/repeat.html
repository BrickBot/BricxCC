<!-- repeat -->
<p> The repeat statement executes a loop a specified number of times. This control structure is not included in the set of Standard C looping constructs. NXC inherits this statement from NQC. The syntax is shown below. </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"> repeat (expression) body
</pre></div>
<p> The expression determines how many times the body will be executed. Note: the expression following the repeat keyword is evaluated a single time and then the body is repeated that number of times. This is different from both the while and do-while loops which evaluate their condition each time through the loop.</p>
