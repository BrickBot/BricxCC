<P>If you want to steer your robot with the computer as remote control, choose <B>Brick Joystick</B> in the <B>Tools</B> menu. Brick Joystick can work in two modes. The first mode assumes that two motors drive the left and right wheel of the robot. The second mode assumes one motor is used for driving and the other for steering. Indicate the correct. (The mode will be saved.) Below this you can indicate which motor is the left (or driving) motor, and which one it the right (or steering) motor. You can also indicate whether they should be reversed. Finally you can indicate the speed. </P>

<P>Now you are ready to move your robot. This can be done with joystick (if you have one), mouse, or keyboard. Moving with the joystick works as expected.  (If the robot moves in the wrong direction, check the settings.) The buttons on the joystick (1-2 or 1-4 depending on your joystick) start the corresponding tasks in the brick. To use this, write a little NQC program that defines the first two (or four) tasks. (Let main just be a dummy task.) Download it but don’t start it. Now use the joystick to start the tasks.</P>

<P>To move the robot with the mouse, click on the buttons with the arrows. If you use the left mouse button, the robot moves in the direction as long as you keep the mouse button pressed. If you click with the right mouse button, the robot keeps on moving until you click another button. Clicking the buttons <B>T1</B> or <B>T2</B> starts task one or two in the robot. To move the robot with the keyboard, use the numeric keypad (make sure the NumLock key is pressed). As long as you keep the keys pressed, the robot move in the direction.</P>
