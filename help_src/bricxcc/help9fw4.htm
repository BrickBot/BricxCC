<P>To directly control the brick, choose the command <B>Direct Control</B> from the <B>Tools</B> menu. This opens a window with the following possibilities:</P>

<P><B>Sensors</B></P>

<P>Here you can set the mode and type of the three sensors.  For CyberMaster and Spybot, only the mode can be set. The type shows which sensor you use.  This function is not available for the Scout.</P>

<P><B>Motors</B></P>

<P>Here you can directly control the three motors of the robot. For each motor you have four options: Moving forwards, moving backwards, off (braking) and float (not braking). You can also set the speed of each motor.</P>

<P><B>Variables</B></P>

<P>Here you can set variables in the brick. At the left choose the variable you like to change; in the middle, choose the operation (set, add, subtract, multiply, divide, logical and, logical or); and at the right choose the value with the up and down arrows, or type it in. Now press <B>Set</B> to make the change in the brick. </P>

<P><B>Tasks</B></P>

<P>Here you can start and stop the 10 tasks (6 for the Scout, 4 for the CyberMaster, 8 for the Spybot) that are in the current program in the brick. If you start a task that is already running, it is restarted. Starting and stopping tasks is useful for testing your code and for making remotely controlled robots. For the second application you can also use the Joystick.</P>
