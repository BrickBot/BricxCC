<P>The RCX supports a Datalog feature.  The RCX can write data into an internal datalog which can then be uploaded to the computer. Creating the datalog and writing data to it is done by the program running in the RCX. See the NQC documentation on how to do this. Uploading the datalog needs to be done from the computer. </P>

<P>The <B>Datalog</B> item in the <B>Tools </B>menu open a window in which you can upload this datalog. Simply press the button labeled <B>Upload Datalog</B> and the contents of the datalog is shown. </P>

<P>You can also change the size of the datalog by choosing or typing in a size. Please realize that each item requires 3 bytes in the RCX. Because the memory of the RCX is rather small preferably make a small datalog. Changing the datalog size will erase its contents. The button <B>Clear Datalog</B> sets the size to 0.</P>

<P>Once you have uploaded data from the RCX you can analyze (i.e., graph the data) in two ways.  The first method, selected via the <B>Analyze</B> button, treats every data point of the same type as a Y value with the X values incrementing by 1 for each new datapoint.  The second method treats the data as if it is a set of X,Y pairs (i.e., every two data elements uploaded are combined into one X,Y coordinate).  The analysis form is identical to the one used when you choose to graph the data obtained via polling the brick from the <B>Watching the Brick</B> form.</P>

<P>You can save the contents of the datalog window to a file by pressing the button labeled <B>Save</B>.  You can also load a previously saved datalog via the <B>Load</B> button.</P>
