<P>
On the Options tab you can set some preferences concerning the editor windows. 
First of all you can indicate whether you want color-coding (aka syntax highlighting) or not. 
Secondly, you can indicate whether the templates should also be put in a popup menu that appears when you click the right mouse button in the edit window. 
You can switch off macros such that &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Alt&gt; combinations are available for special characters. 
You can also decide whether the editor should hide the selection when another window has focus.
You can choose the font used in the editor window by clicking on the <B>Editor Font...</B> button. 
Choose where scroll bars will be shown on the editor windows.
Set the maximum number of characters on a single line.
Set the width of tabs.
Set the maximum number of undo operations.
Set the amount of extra space between lines.
Set the character position of the right edge line that shows in the editor window.
</P>
<p>
You can indicate whether or not you like the editor to auto-indent lines of code. 
Specify whether the Alt key turns on column selection mode and whether right clicking moves the editor cursor position.
You can control the scrolling style for end of line (EOL) and for vertical paging.
You can control whether drag and drop editing works.  
Choose whether tabs should be a fixed width or "quick", which means that the width of each tab depends on the whitespace of the line above the current line.
Indicate whether the editor should preserve spaces at the end of each line.
Select whether the home key takes you to the first non-whitespace character on the line or all the way to the start of the line.
Decide if undo operations should be grouped.
For block indenting and unindenting you can turn on or off the option of using the tab or shift-tab key in addition to Ctrl+Shift+I and Ctrl+Shift+U.
You can have the editor show special characters, such as tabs, spaces, and carriage returns.
You can decide whether or not tabs should be converted into spaces.
You can turn on the option to always highlight the current line.
You can also tell the editor to maintain the horizontal cursor position when moving the cursor up or down across lines of varying lengths.
You can enable the automatic setting of the maximum number of characters per line so that it will never truncate long lines.
