<P>After starting BricxCC, the main window is shown with a menu bar, a tool bar, a large area in which editor windows can appear, and a status bar. The default way of working is to indicate that you want a new file (in the toolbar or in the <B>File</B> menu) or to open an existing file, to write the program in the editor window that appears, and then to download it to the brick using the <B>Download</B> command in the <B>Compiler</B> menu. If there are errors in your program, a panel appears at the bottom of the editor window indicating the errors. You can click on the errors to make the cursor move to the corresponding place in your code, such that you can correct the errors. </P>

<P>Note that BricxCC uses syntax highlighting to make your programs more readable. You can configure this syntax highlighting via the <B>Preferences</B> dialog. </P>

<P>You can open multiple files and work on them simultaneously. Use the commands in the <B>Window</B> menu to arrange the different editor windows.  To view a list of all open windows (including any open tool windows) choose <B>View</B> followed by <B>Window List</B> or just press <B>Alt+0</B>.  You can also use <B>Ctrl+Tab</B> to quickly cycle through the set of open editor windows.</P>
