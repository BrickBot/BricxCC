<P>When you start BricxCC, it first asks you for the COM port or USB tower to connect to the robot.   Press <B>Ok</B> to automatically detect it or choose the port yourself. (If you press <B>Cancel</B>, no connection is made and certain options are not available.) The program now tries to locate the tower used for communication with the brick.  If it cannot find it, certain options are unavailable.  Next it tries to find the brick itself. If it cannot find it you are notified. Try turning on the brick or move the robot closer to the tower, and press <B>Ok</B> to try again.</P>

<P>You can also choose the type of programmable brick firmware with which you wish to communicate. Please note that for the CyberMaster, once the software has established the connection to the robot, you should not switch the robot off and on again. The CyberMaster requires some special startup sequence whenever you switch it off. If this happens by incident, Choose <B>Turn Brick Off</B> from the <B>Tools</B> menu, switch the robot back on, and then choose <B>Find Brick</B>.</P>

<P>If your tower is always connected to the same port you probably don’t want to see the form each time you start the program. This can be changed in the <B>Preferences</B> item in the <B>Edit</B> menu.</P>

<P>You can also start the program by dragging an NQC file to the icon, or by double clicking on an NQC file and indicating that it should be started with BricxCC.</P>
