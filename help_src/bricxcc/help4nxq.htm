<P><I>version 3.3</I></P>

<P>Written by John Hansen</P>

<P>(Based on code originally written by Mark Overmars)</P>
</center>

<P>Bricx Command Center (BricxCC) was written to more easily work with the Lego MindStorms, CyberMaster, and Spybot robot systems.  It is built around NQC (Not Quite C Compiler), written by Dave Baum, that makes it possible to program the RCX, the Scout, the Cybermaster, and the Spybot programmable bricks in a language that is close to C. For more information on NQC, see the tutorial and NQC reference guide provided.   BricxCC also supports programming these bricks via MindScript and LASM, LEGO's own programming languages, via the LEGO MindStorms SDK 2.5.</P>

<P>The foundation of BricxCC is a full-featured programmer's editor in which you can write your programs with the integrated ability to compile the programs and download them to the brick. In case of errors they are reported at the bottom of the editor window such that they can be corrected easily. In addition to providing an editor, BricxCC contains tools to control your robot directly, to watch what is happening in the brick, to download (new) firmware, etc.</P>

<P>To run BricxCC it is not necessary to have spirit.ocx (the ActiveX control used with the RIS 1.0 and 1.5 sets) registered on your system.</P>

<P>BricxCC can be used free of charge. Please note that NQC and it documentation are copyrighted by Dave Baum &amp; John Hansen.  BricxCC supports version 2.3r1 or later of NQC. See the readme file for more information on copyright and distribution issues. Please send your comments to bricxcc@comcast.net. See the web page</P>
