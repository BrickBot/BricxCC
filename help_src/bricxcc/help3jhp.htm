<P>Use this dialog to configure a large number of parameters for the selected series.  It is accessed from the <A HREF="help5awd.htm">Data Analysis</A> dialog using the <A HREF="help9i3x.htm">Select Series</A> dialog (<B>Ctrl-S</B>) or by clicking the left mouse button directly on one of the series in the chart while holding down the <B>Ctrl</B> key.</P>

<P>The available configuration options for a series depend on the chart type.  Some of the options are always available regardless of the chart type.  One of the options you can always configure is the series <B>Title</B>.  The default title is based on the data and you can change this value to be whatever title you choose.  </P>

<P>The other options that are always configurable regardless of the chart type are on the <B>Marks</B> tab.  Marks are labels next to each data point in a series.  You can select whether these marks are visible or not (by default they are not visible).  You can configure the format of each mark by specifying the background color, transparency, clipping, font, border visibility, and border width.  You can specify the length and color of the arrow between the mark and the data point.  Finally, you can select the desired mark style.</P>

<P>If the chart type is a Point chart then you can also configure options on the <B>Point</B> tab.  A point is a small shape on the chart that represents the actual data value for each item in a series.  On this tab you configure the point visibility, 3D appearance, whether or not to inflate the margin, width, height, and style of the point.  You can also configure the border visibility, width, color, and style.</P>

<P>If the chart type is an Area chart then you can also configure options on the <B>Area</B> tab.  On this tab you can configure the area pattern and color.  You can choose whether to use stairstep areas and whether or not to color each section of the area differently.  You can also configure the border visibility, width, color, and style.  You can configure area line visibility, width, color, and style.  And you can select multiple areas for none, stacked, or stacked 100%.</P>
