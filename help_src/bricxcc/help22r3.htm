<P>Choosing the <B>Brick Piano</B> menu item in the <B>Tools</B> menu, you can make the brick play music. If you play with your mouse on the piano, the brick makes the corresponding sounds. At the bottom left you can select the length of the notes. Add rests to your music using the <B>rest</B> button. The sequence of notes you play is stored. Press the <B>Play</B> button to play the whole sequence. Press <B>Clear</B> to clear the stored notes. </P>

<P>Pressing <B>Save</B> gives you the opportunity to save the collection of notes as an NQC program. You can load this program in the editor and download it to the robot. Finally clicking <B>Copy</B> copies the collection of notes as NQC code to the clipboard. In the editor you can paste it into you program. Note that Brick Piano defines two constant in your NQC code: __NOTETIME and __WAITTIME. You can change these to change the speed of the tune.</P>
