<P>The NQC API defines a set of constants, functions, values, and macros that provide access to various capabilities of the target such as sensors, outputs, timers, and communication. Some features are only available on certain targets. Where appropriate, a section's title will indicate which targets it applies to. The RCX2 and Swan firmwares are a superset of RCX features, so if RCX is listed, then the feature works with the original firmware, the 2.0 firmware, and the Swan firmware. If RCX2 is listed, then the feature only applies to the 2.0 firmware and the Swan firmware.  If Swan is listed alone, then the feature only applies to the Swan firmware. CyberMaster, Scout, and Spybotics are indicated by CM, Scout, and Spy respectively.</P>

<P>The API consists of functions, values, and constants. A function is something that can be called as a statement. Typically it takes some action or configures some parameter. Values represent some parameter or quantity and can be used in expressions. Constants are symbolic names for values that have special meanings for the target. Often, a set of constants will be used in conjunction with a function. For example, the <CODE>PlaySound</CODE> function takes a single argument which determines which sound is to be played. Constants, such as <CODE>SOUND_UP</CODE>, are defined for each sound.</P>
