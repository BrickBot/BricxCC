<P>Two forms of comments are supported in NQC. The first form (traditional C comments) begin with /* and end with */. They may span multiple lines, but do not nest:</P>

<PRE><CODE>/* this is a comment */
/* this is a two
line comment * /
/* another comment...
/* trying to nest...
     ending the inner comment... */
this text is no longer a comment! */</CODE></PRE>

<P>The second form of comments begins with // and ends with a newline (sometimes known as C++ style comments).</P>

<PRE><CODE>// a single line comment</CODE></PRE>

<P>Comments are ignored by the compiler. Their only purpose is to allow the programmer to document the source code.</P>
