<P>This is actually a measure of the current being drawn by the motor. The values returned tend to fluctuate slightly, but are, on average, as follows for an unladen motor:</P>

<P>0 motor is floating</P>

<P>1 motor is off</P>

<P>&lt;=7 motor is running at around this power level. This is where the value fluctuates the most (probably related to the PWM method used to drive the motors.) In any case, you should know what power level you set the motor to in the first place. The value increases as the load on the motor increases, and a value between 260 and 300 indicates that the motor has stalled.</P>
