<P>NQC stands for Not Quite C, and is a simple language for programming several LEGO MINDSTORMS products. Some of the NQC features depend on which MINDSTORMS product you are using. This product is referred to as the target for NQC. Presently, NQC supports six different targets: RCX, RCX2 (an RCX running 2.0 firmware), CyberMaster, Scout, Spybotics, and Swan (an RCX running Dick Swan's enhanced firmware).</P>

<P>All of the targets have a bytecode interpreter (provided by LEGO) which can be used to execute programs. The NQC compiler translates a source program into LEGO bytecodes, which can then be executed on the target itself. Although the preprocessor and control structures of NQC are very similar to C, NQC is not a general purpose language – there are many restrictions that stem from limitations of the LEGO bytecode interpreter.</P>

<P>Logically, NQC is defined as two separate pieces. The NQC language describes the syntax to be used in writing programs. The NQC API describes the system functions, constants, and macros that can be used by programs. This API is defined in a special file built in to the compiler. By default, this file is always processed before compiling a program.</P>

<P>This document describes both the NQC language and the NQC API. In short, it provides the information needed to write NQC programs. Since there are several different interfaces for NQC, this document does not describe how to use any specific NQC implementation. Refer to the documentation provided with the NQC tool, such as the NQC User Manual for information specific to that implementation.</P>
