<P><A NAME="idh_nqc_tasks"></A>2.2.1 Tasks</P>

<P>The RCX implicitly supports multi-tasking, thus an NQC task directly corresponds to an RCX task. Tasks are defined using the task keyword using the following syntax:</P>

<PRE><CODE>task <I>name</I>()
{
// the task's code is placed here
}</CODE></PRE>

<P>The name of the task may be any legal identifier. A program must always have at least one task - named "main" - which is started whenever the program is run. The maximum number of tasks depends on the target - the RCX supports 10 tasks, CyberMaster supports 4, Scout supports 6, and Spybotics supports 8.</P>

<P>The body of a task consists of a list of statements. Tasks may be started and stopped using the start and stop statements (described in the section titled <I>Statements</I>). There is also an RCX API command, <CODE>StopAllTasks</CODE>, which stops all currently running tasks.</P>
