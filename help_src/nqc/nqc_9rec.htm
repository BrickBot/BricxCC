<P>Return the current value of the tachometer for a specified motor. The two internal motors have tachometers, which measure 'clicks' and speed as the motors turn. There are about 50 clicks per revolution of the shaft. The tachometers can be used, for example, to create a robot which can detect if it has bumped into an object without using any external sensors. The tachometers have maximum values of 32767 and do not differentiate between directions. They will also count up if the shaft is turned by hand, including when no program is running.</P>
